# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, these are placeholders. In production, you would create proper icon images for the extension.

You can create icons using tools like:
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- Canva
- Or any image editing software

The icons should represent the Knowledge-Weaver brand and be recognizable in the Chrome toolbar and extension management page.
